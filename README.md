# **🛠️ Create Your Visual Studio Code Copilot Extension for Enterprise**

You have become a user of GitHub Copilot, using AI to assist you in becoming a professional developer. But in some enterprise scenarios, we will face different coding requirements, such as the enterprise's coding style, the enterprise's test case writing, and the enterprise's project document writing requirements, etc. You may find that GitHub Copilot needs an upgrade, or you may choose the GitHub Copilot Waitlist product and be frustrated by the long wait. In this workshop, I will tell you how to use Azure OpenAI Service combined with Semantic Kernel and Promptflow to create a customized Visual Studio Code Copilot Extension for internal enterprises.

👀 This extension does not replace GitHub Copilot, but adds more enterprise functions based on GitHub Copilot.

From the diagram, we see that the general part is completed by using GitHub Copilot, while the enterprise part needs to be completed by the method mentioned in this workshop. The following are several steps of the Workshop

**👣 1. Visual Studio Code Extension Development**

You'll learn how to customize a Visual Studio Code extension and prototype a extension for enterprise Copilot programming
